# UQMechMining-Scientific-Computing-Group

A container for the slides, tools and tricks from the Practice of Scientific Computing Group at UQ.

My opinion is that each presenter should have their own sub-directory, with sub-directories for the slides and one for scripts and stuff that you show e.g.

/Lachlan-Whyborn-27-03-2020/Slides/... and /Lachlan-Whyborn-27-03/2020/Scripts/...

When you commit, the message should contain name and date and maybe the specific theme if your talk had one.

Any other suggestions appreciated.
